The Universal Notebook is a conceptual hybrid of an application and operating system. As a journalist and writer, I wanted to find a way to generate more value from a life of note-taking and note-making. Minimally, a universal notebook makes relevant content — notes, previously published work, journals, transcripts, correspondence, reading annotations, etc. — instantly available to knowledge workers while they are working without unnecessary context shifting.

Unpacking that just a little, by instantly available I mean that the content of writing produced at any time in the past can share a visual plane (such as a screen) with  present work, summoned by any number of retrieval methods — a list of files or bookmarks, a visual graph, search results, or sets or links, tags, or other relational tools.

A more expansive set of features might include other tools for thoughts such as those that might be part of an Integrated Writing Environment. In the past, I've identified requirements of a universal notebook, such as:
- Contains files in any format (text, image, pdf, etc)
- Contains both digital (text) and handwritten documents
- Enables organization by both folders and tags
- Enables the use of custom fields for metadata
- Operates across the device ecosystem, such that content can be created, read, updated and deleted from virtually any device.
- Full-text search regardless of origin or file format, including images and pdfs
- Searches can be saved to create dynamic "smart folders"
- Contents can be bulk exported to a common text format
- The application should be API-based, for easy integration with other apps
- The application should enable a non-technical user to generate views of his data — for example, date-based calendar views, kanban-style views, timelines, tables, etc.
