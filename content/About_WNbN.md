# About

_Writing Note by Note_ is a site about the process of writing for the 21st century, written for 21st century practitioners. While _WNbN_ ranges across journalism, content marketing, fiction and literary nonfiction, the tools and practices found here can be extended to any other genre of writing.

I've been writing professionally as a journalist for three decades, as a freelancer and beat reporter, columnist and editor. I've also written academic papers, authored manuals and technical documents, kept journals, published a few short stories and essays, maintained correspondences, and dispatched more memos than I care to remember. And while I hate to admit it, I have an advanced degree in composition.

In short, I belong to the subspecies _homo scriptans_.

The site's content is not intended to be prescriptive. It's banal to say that the one rule of writing is that there are no rules, although in many cases finding — and following — rules is a great path to competence. There's a reason books like those by Strunk and White ([The Elements of Style](https://www.worldcat.org/title/233547782)) and Stephen King ([On Writing](https://www.worldcat.org/title/1158287503)) are perennial best-sellers. But for those who are eager to move from competence to mastery, it's essential to write your own rules. What this means, at bottom, is not that rules don't apply, but that you apply them to meet your own goals.

In the same way, the tools and technologies described here shouldn't be adopted with an expectation that they'll work perfectly for you out of the box. The tool doesn't make the craftsperson. Instead, they are offered in the spirit of example, as personal testimony, and encouragement.

In other words, the originating ethos of _Writing Note by Note_ can probably be articulated in a couple of principles:

1.  Write your own rules
2.  Develop your own tools
3. Find the joy that sustains your practice

I hope the contents of this site, which are only the contents of my own experience, inspire you to do so.
