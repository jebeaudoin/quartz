In the context of [[TUN|The Universal Notebook]], the principle of a single source of truth simply means that content should not be duplicated in order to extend its usability.

For instance, a PKM system that is based on folders might nudge a user to duplicate a file so that it is more readily accessible across the contexts of two or more projects. I might have a rate sheet to provide to clients, and for ease of retrieval I might include it in every client folder. But entropy is real, and it is easy to imagine variants developing.

Similarly, if I am using two different applications as part of my workflow, I might need to duplicate content such that it shows up as a task in my to-do application but as a deadline in my calendar app. But the need to create views of data should not precipitate duplication of data.

Digitalization enables nearly frictionless data duplication which produces scale, but while that facility may provide a short-term benefit, the long-term cost of multiple sources of truth is amplified proportionally int he context of knowledge management.

This is not a new problem, and fortunately solutions include file aliases, shortcuts, symbolic links, tags and labels, etc. Each solution also faces drawbacks, usually related to interoperability between platforms, applications or file systems.
